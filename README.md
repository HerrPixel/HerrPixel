# Hi, I'm Jonas

:mag_right: I am a mathematician, computer scientist and tech guy from Germany.

:wrench: I am mainly doing things in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/)

:hammer_and_wrench: Though I have worked with most progamming languages out there, like **Java**, [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [**Go**](https://go.dev/).
