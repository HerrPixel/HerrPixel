# Hi, I'm Jonas

I am a mathematician, computer scientist and tech guy from Germany.

I am mainly doing things in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/)

Though I have worked with most progamming languages out there, like **Java**, [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [**Go**](https://go.dev/).

## Projects
I am a big fan of the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Below you can find my solutions for the last few years:

## Miscellaneous
For some more interactive things I made, visit **[jonboi.de](https://jonboi.de)**

I am also the author of **[A381294](https://oeis.org/A381294)**, a sequence in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). You can find a writeup on [jonasseiler.de/A381294](https://jonasseiler.de/A381294/) and some code to generate the sequence yourself in [github.com/HerrPixel/A381294](https://github.com/HerrPixel/A381294/).
