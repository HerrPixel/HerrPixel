# Hi, I'm Jonas

I am a mathematician, computer scientist and tech guy from Germany.

I am mainly doing things in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/)

Though I have worked with most progamming languages out there, like **Java**, [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [**Go**](https://go.dev/).

## Projects
I am a big fan of the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Below you can find my solutions for the last few years:

  - **[Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/HerrPixel/AdventofCode2024)**: Written in Go

  - **[Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/HerrPixel/AdventofCode2023)**: Written in Rust

  - **[Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/HerrPixel/AdventofCode2022)**: Written in Julia

More recently I also made **[recall](https://github.com/HerrPixel/recall)**.
